    "## 1. Scoring DQS dimensions\n",
    "This version of the DQS is calculated from the scores of 5 underlying dimensions, each with a weight towards the final score, which are in turn scored based on equal-weighted metrics we use for measuring the dataset's performance in that dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section contains the functions for scoring the dimensions. Each function checks every data \"resource\" in an individual dataset (in CKAN these are called \"packages\", hence the terminology used in the code), and the dataset score is the average of the resource scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: if a dataset has 2 CSV files, each is scored across the dimensions and assigned a DQS, then the dataset DQS is the average of the resource scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usability\n",
    "Accounts for 38% of the DQS. It is composed of 3 metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Meaningful column names: proportion of words in column name in English\n",
    "To determine this, we first split column names by \"\\_\", \" \", \"-\" and camelCase. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* bdngHeightMetres ==> [\"bdng\", \"height\", \"metres\"]\n",
    "* bdng_height_metres ==> [\"bdng\", \"height\", \"metres\"]\n",
    "* bdng height metres ==> [\"bdng\", \"height\", \"metres\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we look at the portion of English words in the resulting array. In this case, 2/3 words are English which means the name gets a \"meaning score\" of 66%.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the meaning score is above a threshold, which we set to 80\\% for now, then the column counts is said to have a \"meaningful name\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done for all the columns in the dataset, so if 7 of 10 column are meaningful, the dataset scores 70\\% for this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Valid geometries (geospatial only)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an automatic check for ensuring the geometry is well-formed across 2 dimensions. A common issue of invalid geometries is the inability to visualize them or work with them - often requires cleanup, thus making them more difficult to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Proportion of columns with a single value (a constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "Checks for columns with a single value, which adds cognitive load to the user - since it's a constant, this could be captured elsewhere (e.g. metadata)."
